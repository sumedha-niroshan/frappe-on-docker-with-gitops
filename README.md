# Frappe Application with GitOps on Docker Using Portainer  

This project demonstrates how to set up and manage a Frappe application using GitOps principles on Docker, orchestrated through Portainer. It includes running multiple Frappe sites within a single Docker environment for efficient resource utilization and scalability.

## 📖 Overview  

GitOps is a modern approach to managing infrastructure and applications using version control systems. By combining GitOps, Docker, and Portainer, this project streamlines the deployment and management of Frappe applications, enabling teams to focus on development while maintaining consistency and reliability in production.

## 🎯 Features  

- **GitOps Workflow**: Automate application deployments using Git as the single source of truth.
- **Dockerized Environment**: Simplify the setup and running of Frappe applications using Docker containers.
- **Portainer Integration**: Manage containers, images, and volumes with a user-friendly GUI.
- **Multi-Site Setup**: Host multiple Frappe sites on a single Docker instance.
